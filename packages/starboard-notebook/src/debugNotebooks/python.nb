/**
   * Send a message to the parent iframe through the iframeResizer library.
   * Optionally you can pass the only target origin you want the message to be sent to, see the iframeresizer docs.
   * Returns whether a listening parent iframe is present (and thus if the message could be sent).
   */
  sendMessage(message: OutboundNotebookMessage, opts?: { targetOrigin?: string }): boolean;

  The following events can be included in the options object attached to the iframed page.

onMessage
type: function (message)
Receive message posted from the parent page with the iframe.iFrameResizer.sendMessage() method.

onReady
type: function()
This function is called once iFrame-Resizer has been initialized after receiving a call from the parent page. If you need to call any of the parentIFrame methods during page load, then they should be called from this event handler.
